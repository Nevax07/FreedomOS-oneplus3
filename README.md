- Linux or Mac

- `Java` is also needed for signed the zip file **(optional)**.
I don't know which version is needed, i use `java-8-jdk` on my Arch Linux.

**How to build :**

```
bash build.sh

It will download all the needed files (1.4Go) and start building your project.
Once you have the needed files, you don't need to re-download them.
